Barbarians scornfully reject the fighter traditions of arms training and discipline, instead tapping into a powerful rage that makes them stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand attacks. They only have the energy for a few such displays per day, but it is usually sufficient. Constant exposure to danger also gives barbarians a sort of ""sixth sense,"" a preternatural ability to sense danger and dodge attacks, and their running stamina is legendary.

73,,,"Bards often serve as negotiators, messengers, scouts, and spies. They love to accompany heroes (and villains) to witness heroic (or villainous) deeds firsthand, since a bard who can tell a story from personal experience earns renown among his fellows. A bard casts arcane spells without any advance preparation, much like a sorcerer. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions, and the bard can also play an inspiring song that strengthens him and his allies. Bards also share some specialized skills with rogues, and their knowledge of item lore is nearly unmatched.

74,,,"Clerics act as intermediaries between the earthly and the divine (or infernal) worlds. A good cleric helps those in need, while an evil cleric seeks to spread his patron's vision of evil across the world. All clerics can heal wounds and bring people back from the brink of death, and powerful clerics can even raise the dead. Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity's domains. These domains grants the cleric special powers, and give him access to spells that he might otherwise never learn.

75,,,"Druids are divine spellcasters who receive their spells from nature, not the gods. They strive to live in harmony with the natural world, and hate anything that is not part of the natural cycle, especially aberrations and undead creatures. As they gain experience, they learn to take the shapes of animals and eventually of more powerful creatures. The strict oaths taken by every druid prohibit using weapons and armor outside their tradition.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level. For example, to cast a 4th-level spell, a druid must have a Wisdom of 14.

76,,,"Fighters can be many things, from soldiers to criminal enforcers. Some see adventure as a way to get rich, while others use their skills to protect the innocent. Fighters have the best all-around fighting capabilities of the PC classes, and they are trained to use all standard weapons and armor. A fighter's rigorous martial training grants him many bonus feats as he progresses, and high-level fighters have access to special melee maneuvers and exotic weapons not available to any other character.

77,,,"Monks are versatile warriors skilled at fighting without weapons or armor. Good-aligned monks serve as protectors of the people, while evil monks make ideal spies and assassins. Though they don't cast spells, monks channel a subtle energy, called ki. This energy allows them to perform amazing feats, such as healing themselves, catching arrows in flight, and dodging blows with lightning speed. Their mundane and ki-based abilities grow with experience, granting them more power over themselves and their environment. Monks suffer unique penalties to their abilities if they wear armor, as doing so violates their rigid oaths. A monk wearing armor loses their Wisdom and level based armor class bonuses, their movement speed, and their additional unarmed attacks per round.

78,,,"Paladins take their adventures seriously, and even a mundane mission is, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test - an opportunity to demonstrate bravery, to learn tactics, and to do good in the world. Divine power protects these warriors of virtue, warding off harm, protecting them from disease, healing them and their allies, and guarding against fear. Divine power also guides their sword arms, making them among the most effective warriors against undead and evil outsiders. Many of the paladin's special abilities also benefit from a high Charisma score.

79,,,"Rangers are skilled stalkers and hunters who make their home in the woods. Their martial skill is nearly the equal of the fighter, but they lack the latter's dedication to the craft of fighting. Instead, the ranger focuses his skills and training on a specific enemy - a type of creature he bears a vengeful grudge against and hunts above all others. Rangers often accept the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. His skills allow him to move quietly and stick to the shadows, especially in natural settings, and he also has special knowledge of certain types of creatures. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw on natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does, and like a druid he is often accompanied by animal companions. 

WARNING: To cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level. For example, to cast a 3rd-level spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom of 13.

80,,,"Rogues have little in common with each other. While some - maybe even the majority - are stealthy thieves, many serve as scouts, spies, investigators, diplomats, and simple thugs. Rogues are versatile, adaptable, and skilled at getting what others don't want them to get. While not equal to a fighter in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and a sneak attack can dish out a lot of damage. Rogues also seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop nearly magical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, a rogue can sometimes ""fake it"" well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.

- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 8 + Int Modifier."
81,,,"Sorcerers are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories - just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level. For example, to cast a 9th-level spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma of 19.

82,,,"Wizards are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells; everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar: a small, magical, creature that serves her.

Specifics: The Deep Gnomes are often counted among the evil creatures within the Underdark, however they are no more evil than any other rock gnome common on the surface.

Unlike their cousins, Rock Gnomes are found across Faerun and integrate well into the rolling countryside towns found across Tethyr and the Heartlands.

Specifics: The ghostwise are some of the most uncommon halflings one might encounter in Faerun. Most make their home in the Chondalwood and prefer to pursue a nomadic lifestyle in the forests. Clan loyalty is of the outmost importance to a Ghostwise Halfling, and the most likely reason for seeing a Ghostwise halfling outside of the Chondalwood is expulsion and exile."

Named for the Sulduskoon River in the southern Wealdath, these elves reject arcane magic in any form and the only divine power they trust comes from the druidic circle. Isolated as they are, the Suldusk elves take a dim view of those who would settle the Wealdath by changing it."

129,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Specifics: You are recognized in the duchy of Noromath as a lower ranking member of Duke Allain Kevanarial's warband.

139,,,"Feat Type: Lineage

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. 
If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.

Saving Throw:None
Spell Resistance:No
Any iron or iron alloy item you touch becomes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell. 
You may employ rusting grasp in combat with a successful melee touch attack. Rusting grasp used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) through corrosion. 
Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. 
Note: Striking at an opponent’s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around. 
Against a ferrous creature, rusting grasp instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. "

36573,,,"The mouse is a manual drill, rotated by simple handles. This machine is usually used in conjunction with a gallery shed, since the whole thing is totally exposed. Realistically though, it stands little chance against a stone castle. Alas, you'd stand a better chance carving a tunnel with a spoon. Still, If you have loads of spare time on your hands and an unprotected patch of wall, it's a cheap way to carve a hole in it."
36574,,,"The activation concept is simple, though there are many variations of these spring type engines. This particular design, known as the scorpion is characterized by the main launching, or striking, arm being bent back and held under tension. When the arm is released, it strikes and launches an arrow. This is a true direct-firing weapon in the sense that the fired projectile has a straight line trajectory. A crew of 4 is necessary for proper usage, giving a rate of fire of about one bolt every other minute. This particular engine is more anti-personnel than structure damaging."
36575,,,"The air smells bad here."
36576,,,"The 'arbalete a tour' is basically a carriage or post mounted crossbow, scaled to fire a five foot shaft. The machine uses a wrench or winch to cock the firing mechanism and consisted of crews of two or more. They are often located in a siege tower. Another setting where this type of engine is common is marine warfare, where size is a limiting factor and a long shaft packs easier than round stones, not to mention the fact that rocks are not all that common on a boat."

36602,,,"The most effective machine that a besieging force can have for direct assault is the high wood tower. Assembled on wheels, it can lower a kind of drawbridge to give passage for the attackers who then are able to charge directly the top of the defended ramparts. The belfries are often made from green sapling trees, cut in the forests close to the besieged places, which reduces their vulnerability to fire. Being of solid build, the structure can support considerable loads - carrying a payload of 50 fighters is not unheard of."
36603,,,"The most versatile attacker on the board, the knight has a peculiar two and over movement style, and is the only piece (aside from the rook and king while castling) that can 'jump' over other pieces. This gives the knight great maneuverability. The knight must move two squares either horizontally or vertically, and then one perpendicular to its original move."
36604,,,"The mouthwatering smell of fresh-baked bread rises from this loaf."
36605,,,"The moveable siege ladder is one of a class of weapons used in offensive siege warfare. The siege ladder allows attacking soldiers to cross moats or other blockades around castle walls. The siege ladder also provides offensive armies with a method of gaining entrance to a castle without first knocking down the castle walls. This design has an extendable ladder, which can elevate. It is however not frequently used because of the difficulty involved in transporting the heavy and bulky vehicle over rough terrain."
36606,,,"The queen is the most powerful piece on the board, capable of unlimited movement in any direction. Despite this, the queen is as vulnerable as any other piece, and makes a prime target. Losing ones queen early can be crippling. The queen can move and capture in any direction."

This in turn, causing the long side to rise quickly. A sling attached to the end of the long side of the beam whips over, releases itself and hurls the projectile it held. Though these machines have many variants, (often a result of on-location assembly) The counterweight type all share the same basic outlay. This particular design requires about 4 individuals to operate and can hurl, 80Kg stones for a distance of about 100 meters. reload time in this machine is relatively slow, requiring several minutes to fire again."
36662,,,"This is a counterweight trebuchet, where the long pivoted beam, has the short side pulled down by the weight of a two hutches filled with gravel. This in turn, causing the long side to rise quickly. A sling attached to the end of the long side of the beam whips over, releases itself and hurls the projectile it held. The two smaller hutches permit easier transport and assembly, also giving excellent horizontal accuracy due to their superior balance. This particular design requires about 4 individuals to operate and can hurl, 80Kg stones for a distance of about 150 meters. It's rate of fire is five to six times higher than that of the  regular single hutch Trebuchet. In the world of counterweight trebuchets, this one can be considered as top dog."

36671,,,"This is a single arm, torsion-powered, stone-throwing engine. This machine has its throwing arm's lower end inserted into twisted sinew and is held in torsion. And the upper throwing end of the arm is installed with a sling, to add the angular momentum of the pouch to the forward thrust of the projectile. The rate of fire is about one shot per minute and a weight of 15Kg can be flung to a distance of 180 Meters with a crew of two."
36672,,,"This is a sticky pool of slime."
36673,,,"This is a strange looking table."
36674,,,"This is a traction trebuchet, or Perrier (rock thrower). The power is provided by muscle. The triangular spreader is used to facilitate several pulling ropes. This particular design has the triangle in a horizontal arrangement. The advantages of this design is that all the pullers' ropes are joined to the beam at the same height, so they all reach their maximum leverage and pull at the same moment of the launch -  giving a potential for a more explosive effort. The triangle also supports the axle, making it easier to build the axle assembly rigid. Movement here can have a large effect on the side-to-side accuracy of the machine. The major disadvantages are that the pullers all reach the point where their efforts have no effect (when their ropes are in line with the beam) at the same time, after which the beam is coasting. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 3, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 10Kg to a distance of about 50 meters. Also since this type has a single upright beam and is very small, construction is very fast and very easy."
36675,,,"This is a traction trebuchet, the power is mainly provided by muscle. The triangular spreader is used to facilitate several pulling ropes. This particular design has the triangle in a vertical arrangement and has an additional weight at the base of the triangle. Such hybrid machines, using both counterweights and manual pulling power are also called Bricole. The advantages of the vertical formation is that The pullers each reach their maximum and minimum efforts at slightly different times thus giving a more even and longer application of power. This allows the machine to throw heavier projectiles. The major disadvantage is that the pullers' maximum efforts and leverage cannot occur at the same time, losing   the explosive team burst of power. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 8, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 25Kg to a distance of about 200 meters."
36676,,,"This is a very flimsy structure."
36677,,,"This is an ominous looking doorway."
36678,,,"This is not truly a siege weapon but more of a weapon used in defense of a besieged keep or castle. This weapon consists of a large pot that is used to hold boiling oil or water or tar that is then poured down on top of the attackers attempting to force their way inside."

One then lays a long spear, several meters in length on the axis. The winch hastens reload time, and the added torsion of the ropes can hurl a projectile to more than 60 meters. This frightening machine is especially used against other machines of war."

A crew of 3 is more than enough to provide a respectable firing rate of about 1 shot per minute."
36686,,,"This mobile ram consists of a long beam armed with an iron head at its end, suspended horizontally with cables or chains, and driven by means of cords fixed at the tail. The crew operating the arm is sheltered under a roof, which facilitates closer proximity to the besieged structure. The belier is mostly used to attack walls, though a gate would make an easier target."
36687,,,"This mobile ram consists of a long beam, suspended horizontally with cables or chains, and driven by means of a handle at the tail. It is unprotected, and the crew operating the arm is exposed to enemy archers. This makes approach to besieged structures a risky venture at best. Given it's drawbacks, this type is mostly used to attack gates, or wooden structures and is virtually useless against well built stone walls."

36701,,,"This shabby looking outhouse is actually an entrance to a mine. A mine is used to damage walls. A tunnel is dug below the foundations of the castle wall. A large chamber is created underneath the foundations by excavating the soil; the wall above being temporarily supported by wooden props. Between these props the miners place combustible material. Once the chamber is deemed to be sufficiently large, the combustible material is set on fire and the miners withdraw. The supporting props eventually burn through and the wall collapses into the chamber. Once a mine is begun, the only defense against it is ounter-mining; i.e. the defenders dig their own tunnel hoping to break in to that of the besiegers and halt its construction or try to flood it. Of course, a good moat can prevent mining altogether."

36710,,,"This siege engine is a hybrid trebuchet, requiring both a counterweight and traction for activation. The mangonneau is an enormous machine which requires the presence of 12 artillerists and  a chief of operation. The lever is lowered using a winch operated  by two wheels, six people are necessary because the counterweight  weighs several tons. When the lever is lowered the pocket of the  sling can be armed with a large stone ball or even several stones. The chief of operation gives the signal, the lever is released and  a group of gunners are suspended on the cords and accelerate the  upswing of the sling. The aiming process is rather long and one  must often carry out many tests. This machine can launch a heavy  projectile of about 100Kg only every approximately two hours, but  as soon as the calibration is finished the damage caused to fortifications is considerable. The projectile can reach a distance  of up to 150 meters. The Rather complicated nature of the reloading mechanism and the  enormous counterweight, produce a great deal of stress on the  frame, this in turn, massively reduces the life span of the mechanism."

Specifics: Whether you have traveled a great distance or a short one, your church has sent you on a critical mission. The spiritual well-being of the people of Tethyr is at stake.

Those who speak against the crown are your enemies and they must have their views challenged in a contest of steel.

148338,,,"<c002></c>Background: Soldier"
148339,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Specifics: Lacking the privilege that knights come with, you still aspired to become a great warrior in your youth. Since then, you have learned the cost of war as a footsoldier on the front lines.

148347,,,"Feat Type: Lineage

These are seen as the most civilized and haughty elves, preferring to remain separate from non-elven races. Seeing a Gold Elf is typically more rare than a Dark Elf in the Lands of Intrigue."
148564,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Gold Dwarf"
148565,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: Dwarf
ECL: +0
Specifics: Unlike the Shield Dwarves, the Gold Dwarves maintained their Great Kingdom in the Rift and did not decline in terrible wars against evil humanoids. While they practiced some magic, they never acquired the hubris that caused the downfall of some human nations. Confident and secure in their remote home the Gold Dwarves gained a reputation for haughtiness and pride. "
148566,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Grey Dwarf"
148567,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: Dwarf
ECL: +1
Specifics: Long ago, mindflayers conquered the strongholds of Clan Duergar of the Dwarven Kingdom of Shanatar. After generations of enslavement and cruel experimentation at the hands of the Illithids, the Duergar rose against their masters and regained their freedom. They emerged as a new subrace of Dwarf with limited magical powers. Many Grey Dwarves have escaped the Underdark for the promise of a better life on the surface - only to be met with extreme prejudice. Their only hope is now to reclaim their ancient Kingdom of Shanatar and the Wyrmskull Throne - located beneath Tethyr."
148568,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Shield Dwarf"
148569,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: Dwarf
ECL: +0
Specifics: The sculpted halls and echoing chambers of Dwarven Kingdoms are scattered through the Underdark like forgotten necklaces of semiprecious stones. Dwarven Kingdoms such as Xonathanur, Oghrann, and Gharraghaur taught the less civilized races of Faerun what it meant to hold and wield power. Unlike the ancient human empires, the Dwarves distrusted magic - so they were never seduced to the heights of magical folly that toppled Netheril and Imaskar. Instead, the Dwarves became locked in eternal wars with goblin kind and the other dwellers of the Underdark. One by one, the empires of the North failed - leaving only scattered survivors in the mountains or unconquered sections of the Underdark."
148570,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Calishite"
148571,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: These humans are descended from the slaves of Calimshan's ancient genie lords, form the primary racial stock of the Border Kingdoms, the Lake of Steam cities, the Nelanther Isles, and Calimshan. Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. they regard themselves as the rightful rulers of all lands south and west of the Sea of Fallen Stars and look upon northern cultures as short-lived barbarian kingdoms barely worthy of notice. Most Calishites seek nothing more than a lifestyle of comfort and the respect of their peers."
148572,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Chondathan"
148573,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: Descended from the natives of the Vilhon Reach, these hardy folk have spread to settle most of the western and central Inner Sea region and much of the Western Heartlands. Chondathans form the primary racial stock of Altumbel, Cormyr, the southern Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, the Great Dale, Hlondeth and both shores of the Vilhon Reach, the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, Sembia, and Sespech. They are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. The Chondathan domination of central Faerun came about largely by virtue of extensive trade and settlement rather than by force of arms. Many Chondathans are merchants of one sort or another, and they are not afraid to take risks, travel, or settle new lands."
148574,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Damaran"
148575,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: Proud and stubborn, these humans were born from some scattered remnants of Narfell's fall - primarily groups of Nars, Rashemis, and Sossrims who struggled to survive while waves of Chondathan emigrants settled in the lands of the Easting Reach. These four populations gradually coalesced into a new ethnic group that now makes up the primary racial stock of Damara, Impiltur, Thesk, and the Vast. Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is most common. Damarans see the world in stark contrasts - unspeakable evil opposed by indomitable and uncompromising good. Most Damarans are farmers, loggers, or miners in a harsh and unforgiving land."
148576,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Illuskan"
148577,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: The seagoing, warlike people of the Sword Coast North, the Trackless Sea, and the Dessarin river valley, Illuskans are fall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Among the islands of the Trackless Sea and Icewind Dale, their hair color tends towards blond, red, or light brown. On the mainland south of the Spine of the World, however, raven-black hair is most common. Illuskans are proud, particularly of their ability to survive in the harsh environment of their northern homelands, and they regard most southerners as weak and decadent. Illuskans make their living as farmers, fishers, miners, sailors, raiders, skalds, and runecasters."
148578,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Mulan"
148579,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: Members of this ethnic group have dominated the eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen stars since the fall of ancient Ilmaskar. At various times in their long history, they have made up at least the ruling elite of Ashanath, Chessenta, the Eastern Shaar, Murghom, Rashemen, Semphar, Thay, Thesk, and the Wizards' Reach cities south of the Yuirwood. Mulan are generally tall, slim, and sallow-skinned with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but all nobles and many other Mulan routinely shave off all of their hair. As a race, Mulan are arrogant, conservative, and convinced of their cultural superiority over the rest of Faerun."
148580,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Rashemi"
148581,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: These humans are tough, sturdy, and well adapted to life in the harsh and dangerous northeastern reaches of Faerun. They are descended from the nomadic tribes that won the Orcgate Wars and built the empire of Raumathar. Not only do the Rashemis dominate Rashemen and Thay, they also form significant minorities in Aglarond, the Endless Wastes, Thesk, and the Wizards' Reach region. Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular, and they usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick, black hair. They cherish their strong ties to their land, appreciating its beauty while respecting its harshness. They display little of the arrogance that marks other groups whose ancestors once ruled empires."
148582,,,"<c001></c>Ethnicity/Subrace: Tethyrian"
148583,,,"Feat Type: Lineage
Requirements: None
Specifics: The Tethyrian culture is a melting pot of Calishite, Chondathan, Illuskan, and Low Netherese elements. This unique background makes Tethyrians among the most tolerant, though fiercely independent, ethnic groups in Faerun. They inhabit a vast territory stretching from Calimshan to Silverymoon, and from the Sea of Swords to the Sea of Fallen Stars. Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that grows fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color vary widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians are proud of their diverse heritage and protective of their freedom, so they tend to distrust powerful kingdoms and empires.
"
148584,,,"The Elves of Tethyr are primarily of the Elmanesse and the Suldusk Tribes - commonly known as Copper and Green Elves. They are the remnants of the original elven settlers of Keltormir, the greatest of forest kingdoms, established over twenty thousand years ago.  They sought to retreat from the troubles of the world - before the forest began to shrink due to the warring Djinni that founded what would become Calimshan. The elves have retained their reclusiveness and distrust of humankind ever since.

148585,,,"Tethyr rests above the ancient ruins of Shanatar, where eight great Dwarven Kingdoms were once united under the Wyrmskull Throne. Whispers amongst the clansmen speak of a time when the Wyrmskull will rise to power once again. Whether you are a Shield Dwarf, Gold Dwarf, or even from Clan Duergar you are chasing the rumors of this wonder. The honor of your clan means everything to you, and the desire to earn the respect of your people by reclaiming this ancient kingdom drives you to deeds of valor."
148586,,,"For thousands of years, elves have ruled the Wealdath in seclusion. Now, an ogre army from the north as well as constant human conflicts in the Swordbelt have created tensions amongst the elves. Whether you are a native to the Wealdath or an outsider, the difference will mean little to your human counterparts."
148587,,,"The ongoing war and strife in Tethyr makes the marginalized life of a gnome even more difficult. Whatever your skilled trade is, you are accustomed to second class treatment and lesser pay. Being deemed unfit for battle in most cases, you are fortunately overlooked most of the time."
148588,,,"Halflings in Tethyr are walking with a longer stride today, as more and more of the small-folk join Queen-Monarch Zaranda Star's new noble and knightly classes. The horrors of war unfortunately are unkind to everyone, particularly the small and ill-equipped halflings that made up most peasant brigades during the Interregnum. Though some have benefited from the new Monarch's polices, halfling knights are few and far between."
148589,,,"Half-Elves are generally looked down upon in Tethyrian society, and even more-so they are despised by the elves of the Wealdath for what they represent. Although some half-elves do earn the acceptance of their parent elven tribes, they are more likely to find family amongst human companions. They are not able to hold lands or titles without special dispensation. "
148590,,,"Two years ago, Queen-Monarch Zaranda Star declared that the monsterous be driven out of all Tethyrian lands. Unfortunately for you, you are considered a monsterous race in Tethyr. Though you may attempt to distinguish yourself with honor and valor when the opportunity arises, you will never be accepted or tolerated for very long. The most well respected of half-orcs in Tethyr also so happens to also be a martyr. "
148591,,,"There are almost four million humans in Tethyr, yet among them even a lesser noble stands out. You may come from wealth or squalor, but the ongoing relief from the civil war provides many opportunities for advancing ones station in life. However you choose to distinguish yourself, it will take cunning, steel and the help of your companions to maintain your place in the Lands of Intrigue. As a human, you are able to hold lands, titles, and nobility that is simply out of reach for other races."

148646,,,"eldritch knight"
148647,,,"(PRESTIGE CLASS)
Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast a fireball on her foes or charge them with sword drawn. The eldritch knight takes pride in her ability to use the right technique for the job: spells against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting enemies.
Eldritch knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and arcane study to learn more powerful spells. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort. Eldritch knights are never truly at home among arcane spell-casters or elite soldiers, so many drift from wizard school to mercenary unit to band of adventurers.

Those who suffer the depredations of wild beasts attempt to placate the Beastlord with offerings of freshly killed and bloody meat, but Malar rarely recognizes their entreaties. In his more favorable aspects he is revered by beings who identify with the untamed nature, grace and amorality of predators. Survival of the fittest and winnowing the weak are Malar's legacy. A brutal, bloody death has great meaning: ""May you die an old man"" is an insult among Malarites. The hunt is the fulcrum of life and death, and the focus point of life is the challenge between the hunter and the prey, the judgement of who may live or die. Malarites are expected to view every important task as a hunt and to remain ever alert and alive. They must walk the wilderness without trepidation, as Malar does, and must show no fear in the hunt.

One school of thought believe the god totally destroyed after reading the Cyrinishad and having his Godsbane avatar form destroyed by Cyric, another held that Mask was totally subsumed by Cyric, and a third school believed that Mask, engaged in his own inrigues, faked his loyalty to Cyric and later his own death. The truth is that Mask survived the enslaving effects of the Cyrinishad and the destruction of a major avatar form at great cost, losing much of his godly power in the process. All that occurs within shadow is in the purview of Mask. Ownership is nine-tenths of what is right, and if a person happens to currently have something, it is his or hers. Previous ownership does not count. Therefore, the day belongs to the quick, the smooth-tongued, and the light-fingered.

Deneir is the other hand. Deneir, Gond, and Milil serve OGhma, though Milil has little in common with Gond, and their relationship is strained. He is on excellent terms with a number of powerful gods, including Mystra and Sune, and often works closely with Lliira. He is welcome in the elf pantheon as well as the Faerunian pantheon because of the beauty of his song. Milil is a god of creativity and inspiration, of the whole song more than just the lyrics or the music. He represents the finished thought, the process that takes an idea from conception to completion.

She is said to have taught the first spellcaster of the Realms, and to have enabled many of the races to use magic. She supposedly weighs and judges each new spell or magical item to determine whether it should be permitted into the Realms. She is most venerated by wizards and those who use magic or magical items in their daily use. She differs from Azuth in that Azuth is the god of wizards (as to a much lesser degree, all spellcasters), while Mystra is the goddess of teh essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit to enable mortal spellcasters and magical crafters to safely access the raw force that is magic. Mystran advisers are common in Azuthian churches, and vice versa. Choice, decision, and knowledge, leavened with a healthy dose of good for the most individuals, are the hallmarks of Mystra's faith. Magic is great power, and it brings with it great responsibility. Mystra's clergy are given the following charge upon aspiring to the faith: ""Remeber always that magic is an Art, a Gift of the Lady, and that those who can wield it are priviledged in the extreme. Conduct yourself humbly, not proudly, while being mindful of this."" ""Use magic deftly and efficiently; eschew carelessness and recklessnes in the unleashing of the Art. When magic imperils you, hide it or hurl it away into other planes rather than destroy it, for any destruction of Art is a sin."" ""Seek always both to learn new magic and to create new magic, but experimenting to learn to craft something oneself is better than merely buying scrolls or hiring tutors. Exult more in creation than in hurling spells, and ensure that your creations are shared with others and so outlive you. Those who succeed in this last and maturing into true wisdom and consideration for the greater balance of things in Faerun in the use of Art are moost favored in the eyes of the Lady and will server beyond death as beings who have become one with magic and live on in it forever.""

148861,,,"Oghma is the most powerful god of knowledge in Faerun. Much as Mystra of old was said to site in judgement of each new spell, Oghma is said to decide whether a new idea would be known to the world or confined to its orginator. Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors for Oghma, carrying new information both to him and to those whom Oghma favors. He is on good relations with the artificer god, Gond Wonderbringer, who serves him by giving ideas manifest form, but their relationship has sometimes become tense due to Gond's proclivity to press for the rapid introduction of new devices throughout Faerun. Knowledge is the msot supreme, particular in its raw form, the idea. An idea has no weight but can move mountains. It has no height but it can dominate a nation. It has no mass but it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of humankind, outweighing anything made by mortal hands. Before anything can exist, the idea must exist.

Selune's ethos seems to be one of acceptance and tolerance over any other overriding principle. All are to be made welcome in her faith and seen as equal, and fellow Selunites should be aided freely, as if they were one's dearest friends. ""May Selune guide your steps in the night, and bring them to the new dawn"" is the comon blessing of priests of Selune to the faithful. Novices are charged with wods of the goddess: ""Let all on whom my light falls be welcome if they desire to be so. As the silver moon waxes and wanes, so too does all life.

148865,,,"Loss is the nature of Shar. One of the Dark Gods, she is a deeply twisted and perverse being of ineffable evil and endless petty hatred and jealousy. She rules over pains hidden but not forgotten, bitterness carefully nurtured away from the light and from others, and quiet revenge for any slight, no matter how old. She is said to have the power to make her devout followers forget their pain, yet what occurs is that they become inured to the loss, treating it as a common and natural state of being. The basic inanity of life and foolishness of hope are the cornerstones of Shar's being. She revels in the concealed, in that which is hidden, never to be revealed.  She can always clearly perceive every being, object, and act performed within darkness. Dark Followers (the faithful of Shar) are instructed to reveal secrets only to fellow faithful and to never follow hope or turn to promises of success. They should quench the light of the moon (the faithful of Selune and their holdings, deeds, and magic) whenever then find it and hide from it when they cannot prevail. Above all, the dark should be a time to act, not to wait. Faithful of Shar are not supposed to hope and are therefore forbidden to strive to better their lot in life or to plan ahead except in matters directly overseen by the clergy of the Dark Goddess. COnsorting with beings of good alignment who actively serve their deities is a sin unless undertaken to take advantage of them in purely business dealings or to corrupt them from their beliefs into the service of Shar. Devotees of Shar must not speak out against clergy of the goddess, nor interrupt their devotional dances for any reason. Lay worshipers must prove their faith by obedience to the clergy and by carrying out at least one dark deed ordered by a priest of Shar every year - or bringing at least one being to believe in and worship the Dark Goddess.

148867,,,"Shaundakul the Rider of the Winds was the god of travel and exploration in old Myth Drannor. His existance may date back to the time of the Rus, forbears of the Rashemaar, or beyond. In the time of Myth Drannor, he was worshipped by humans and half-elves, particularly those who were caravan merchants, traders, explorers, miners and adventurers in the uncharted wilderness of the Moonsea North. He was a keen-eyed guide who pointed out the hidden lodes and ways of the North, and brought luck and battle-valor to worshipers in need. Priests of Shaundakul are usually quite reserved concerning their fellowship of worship, seeking to spread the teachings of Shaundakul through example. Priests of teh Helping Hand are to actively work to reestablish their god's sphere of influence among traders, particularly trail-blazers who explore new lands and open new trade routes. They are to act as scouts, guards, and leaders for parties of explorers, caravans, and mining expeditions. Theya re to unearth ancient shrines of Shaundakul and re-sanctify them.

148868,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Sune"
148869,,,"Sune Firehair is said to be the fairest of the powers. When she is represented, she is shown as the most beautiful woman in the Realms, with sweeping, radiant, red hair and incredible charms. The Sunite faith is a popular one in large metropolitan areas and among the nobility. Those of a literary or artistic bent, as well as people falling in love or looking for lifemates, often venerate the Lady Firehair. Beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's fair (or foul) face to the world. The followers of Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all, and following one's heart to one's true destination. Fated marches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans are all part of the teaching of Sune. Novice Sunites receivbe the following charge: ""Love none more than yourself save Sune, and lose yourself in love of the Lady Firehair. Perform a loving act every day, and seek to awaken love in someone new each day. Respond to love at least once in a day."" ""Encourage beauty wherever you find it. Acquire beautiful items of all sorts, and encourage, sponsor, and protect the artists who produce such things whenever and wherever you find them."" ""Keep your own body as comely as possible and as attractively displayed as situations warrant. Let haristyle and clothing best suit your personal appearance, striving to stir and delight others who look upon you. Moreoever, hide not away, but always seek to present yourself to those around in a pleasing variety of garbs and activities so as to move them with love and desire.""
"
148870,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Talona"
148871,,,"Talona, one of the Dark Gods, is often depicted as a withered old crone with a scarred, tattooed face in religious texts. Where she walks, misfortune and death follow. She is an odd deity. Sages have described her as having the personality of a petulant, greedy child trapped in the body of a once-beautiful woman now scarred by horrific disease and ravaged by age: she is alternately desirous of attention at any cost like a small child and aloof like a wounded paramour who has been discarded by her love. Talon's ethos stresses that life and death are in balance, but that death is the more powerful and should be paid proper homage and respect. Life and death are balance only because birthing and generation are so plentiful. Death is the true power, and the lesson that waits for all. If it falls to the followers of Talona to drive home the point with the tip of a dagger, so be it. Talona's faithful are taught that if they respect death and the many ways the powers can deal it, that knowledge will allow them to live longer. If people think themselves invincible thanks to wealth or a swift swordarm or strong spells, the great equalizer of disease, Talon's breath, will teach them respect and humility.
"
148872,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Talos"
148873,,,"Talos is the destructive force of nature. He is the god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and general destruction. He attracts the destroyer, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers. His actions often seem petty and vengeful and are frequently motivated by rage, anger, and the desire to not appear weak or compromising in any way to his followers or the other powers of Faerun. He exults in seeing what he or his followers can burn, break, flood, kill or otherwise utterly destroy. He is like a malicious and twisted child whose power and wratch know no bounds and who proves his self-worth and standign again and again by raining havoc and ruin down on those who can little oppose him. Talos the Destroyer is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that lies waiting to strike at any time. Talassans are taught that life is a combination of random effects and chaos, so the devout should grab what they can, when they can, as who can say when Talos will strike and bring them into the afterlife?
"
148874,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Tempus"
148875,,,"Tempus is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side on one day, and against them the next; such is the nature of a war. Tempus is prayed to most of all on the nights before battles and regularly venerated by all warriors, regardless of their alignment. As a result, he is a strong, exuberant, robust god - a warrior's god. Tempus sometimes appears at huge battles and important combats - and on rare occasions to individuals who are in a position to case great strife by their actions. Tempus does not win battles-Tempus helps the deserving warrior win battles. War is fair in that it oppresses all sides equally and that in any given battle, a mortal may be slain or become a great leader among his or her compaions. War should not be feared, but seen as a natural force, a human force, the storm that civilization brings by its very existence.
"
148876,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Torm"
148877,,,"Torm is the patron of paladins and those who face danger for a greater good. In life, Torm was the most faithful of warriors, obeying all the commands of his king regardless of personal danger. Today he is the war arm and champion of Tyr, Lord of Justice, delivering justice to those who are evil, deceitful, and destructive, and acting to keep law, order and loyalty everywhere. The Loyal Fury is unflinching in his duty and judges his faithful accordingly. He is stern, righteous, and unyielding, yet his heart is filled first and foremost with goodness, and he can be a kind and gentle power when dealing with the young, the weak, and faithful friends of all sorts. Torm's is one of the most ethically pure of all faiths in that it is devoted to loyalty and obedience. This is not a blind obedience, and a servant working for an evil master is responsible to a higher authority in his loyalty. The Tormish believe that salvation may be found through service, that every failure diminishes the Lord of Duty, and that every success adds to his luster. They strive to maintain law and order and to obey their masters to their utmost power with alert judgement and anticipation. The Tormish stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to strike quickly and hard against any rot in the hearts of mortals.
"
148878,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Tymora"
148879,,,"Tymora is sometimes called Tyche's fair-haired or fair-tressed daughter or Beshaba's bright sister, but these are more poetic titles than designations of her maternal lineage or her hair color. In actuality, Tymora is half of the deity once known as Tyche, with Beshaba being the other half. Tymora inherited Tyche's grace and kindness when that goddess split into two beings in the Dawn Cataclysm, a war among the gods that long preceded the Time of Troubles and is said to have heralded the fall of Myth Drannor. Beshaba garnered more of Tyche's wanton, willful nature, sensual side, and restless energy. Tymora's faith teaches that one should be bold, for to dare is to live. The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is ""Fortune favors the bold."" A brave heart and willingness to take risks beat out a carefully wrought plan nine times out of ten. One must place oneself in the hands of fate (meaning the hands of TYmora) and trust to one's own luck.
"
148880,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Tyr"
148881,,,"When he is depicted in religious art, Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing his right hand, lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound in proving his resilience and strength of spirit. In recent years, he has been shown blinded as well, a fatality of the wrath of Ao during the Time of Troubles. Tyr's symbol shows his nature: justice through benevolent force and armed vigilance. He opposes all beings who deal in trickery, rule-breaking, and unjust destruction or misdeeds. He is said to be a latecomer among the powers of Faerun, appearing over a millennium ago but after most other Realms powers had established themselves. His faith is popular, as everyone knows exactly what Tyr expects his faithful to do and everyone can trust Tyrrans to be honorable, honest, just, and righteous. Novices of Tyr are charged to: ""Reveal the truth, punish the guilty, right the wrong, and be always true and just in your actions."" Tyr and his followers are devoted to teh cause of justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of just vengeance. This is not necessarily equality or fairness, as some make the maimed god out to represent, but rather the discovery of truth and the punishment of the guilty. Tyrrans tend to be stiff-necked about theology and to see matters in black and white terms.
"
148882,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Umberlee"
148883,,,"Umberlee the Bitch Queen rules from her watery lair in a flooded level of the Abyss. She is worshipped by most out of fear as opposed to adoration, though some few-such as most weresharks, who she created to try to undermine Selune-find her ethos to their liking. Ship crews toss her gems over the sides of their vessels to calm storm-tossed waters. She has a large number of shrines in coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers, candles, small candies, or coins on her altars in hopes that Umberlee will spare them on the next voyage. The Umberlant faith has no set ethical outlook save that the sea is a savage place and those who travel it had best be willing to pay the price of challenging Umberlee's domain. The doctrine of Umberlee declares that all should know Umberlee and fear her, for the wind and wave can reach everywhere.
"
148884,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Finder Wyvernspur"
148885,,,"Finder Wyvernspur recently ascended to godhood by slaying the evil god Moander on its home plane in the Abyss. Finder was a founding member of the Harpers in the Realms, but he was later judged to have betrayed the ideals of that secretive organization when his overweening pride resulted in teh death of one apprentice and the suicide of another. Finder's followers have taken to hear the lessons it took Finder all his life to discover. Art that is forced to remain immutable is a sign of stagnation and spiritual rot. In order to thrive, people must be willing to change and transform their art so they can be renewed by it.
"
148886,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Garagos"
148887,,,"Some legends claim Garagos was the primary war god in western Faerun until he was uverthrown by the upstart Tempus. Certainly garagos was worshiped in Westgate and the Vilhon Reach during the days of Myth Drannor, and his faith was strength even before that time-reportedly even in ancient Netheril. Garagathans believe that peace is for weak fools. War makes all who fight strong, and only in head-to-head conflict is honor satisfied. Only cowards avoid battle. Any who strike down a foe from ambush or from behind are to be scorned as the cowards they are.
"
148888,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Gargauth"
148889,,,"An evil power whose foul nature was too much even for others of his ilk, Gargauth was cast out of his palace in Baator and condemned to wander the Prime Material Plane. Gargauth embodies the inevitable decay and corruption that accompany all self-serving, greedy, and power-hungry leaders and groups. Life is all about the accumulation of power. Civilization is a thin vener over the base desires that make up the core of every living being. Those who wish to survive and prosper must recognize this truth and concengtrate all their resources on the pursuit of power.
"
148890,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Gwaeron Windstrom"
148891,,,"Gwaeron Windstrom embodies the skills of tracking and understanding woodland signs. Gwaeron roamed the North as a mortal ranger many centuries ago, and he was elevated to the ranks of demipowers by the sponsorship of the Lady of Forests after successfully stalking and slaying at least one avatar and several manifestations of Malar in quick succession. Gwaeron's teachings mirror those of Mielikki, whom he serves. Intelligent beings can live in harmony with the wild without requiring the destruction of one in the name of the other. Gwaeronans are taught to embrace the wild and not fear it, because the wild ways are the good ways.
"
148892,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Hoar"
148893,,,"Hoar the Doombringer is not often actively worshiped in set services, but his name is invoked by those seeking vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate (such as when a murderer is killed accidentally just after the murder is committed, particularly if the accident-for example, slipping to his death-was initiated by the murderer himself), the hand of Hoar is given credit. Hoar has a more benign aspect in the North, where he is seen less as a god of vengeance and more as a god of poetic justice. Hoar charges his clergy to uphold true and fitting justice and to maintain the spirit of the law, not the letter of the law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one's actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. One must be careful to walk the line of Hoar's teachings, to seek retribution, but to fall not to pursuing evil acts for evil's sake, for that way is seductive and leads only one's downfall.
"
148894,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Lurue"
148895,,,"Lurue the Unicorn, also known as Silverymoon, is the goddess of talking beasts and good intelligent monsters. She is venerated by many sentient beasts who have inherited or magically acquired the ability to speak human and demihuman languages, While some entire species, such as unicorns, pegasi, and talking owls, venerate her as Queen, many of her worshipers are outcasts from their own kind due to their unique abilities. The Unicorn is a symbol of hope, joy, salvation, and protection for the needy, forlorn, and forsaken. Life is to be relished and lived with laughter. Quests are to be taken on a dare and gifts to be made on a whim. Impossible dreams are to be pursued for the sheer wonder of the possibility of their completion.
"

148897,,,"Nobanion, the Lion God of Gulthmere, is viewed as the protector of that woods, the wild natives with in it, and the nearby Shining Plains. He is typically portrayed as a great male lion or a majestic lammasu. He draws his power from the wild animals of the Vilhon Reach and the Dragon Coast regions, particularly the great cats and the wemics of the Shining Plains. Hunt only when hungry and do not gorge without need. Waste nothing and all shall have plenty. The cycle of life links all living things into one being, and being is life itself. THe law of the jungle is that only the strong survive, but they survive best by being leaders, not tyrants, and by protecting the weak, not bullying them.
"
148898,,,"<c002></c>Deity: Red Knight"
148899,,,"The Red Knight serves Tempus, the Lord of War, as the goess of planning and strategy. She is portrayed as a dark-haired woman in blood-red armor, with a map of the Realms tightly clasped in her hands. The Red Knight keeps her true name secret from all but the Lord of Battles, as she realizes that if any power, mortal or divine, were to gain any measure of control over her, they would be privy to all the plots and stratagems of rulers throughout the Realms and the powers throughout the planes. War is won by those with the best planning, strategy, and tactics, regardless of the apparent odds. Any fool can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory with fortune's aid. Only a master strategist can ensure victory and that it will last.

Some claim that he guides the forces of fate, while others believe he is cursed to know all history but is unable to affect its flow. The blindness of mortals is the origin of all folly. Search for the truth in all things great and small and conceal nothing. Speak only the truth, for lies and misdirection, even for benign motives, are the root of all sorrow. Be not paralyzed by indecision, but take no action without analyzing the implications.

Sharess's priests are expected to live their lives in the decadent sensual fulfillment of themselves and others. Pleasure is to be sought out at every opportunity and life is to be lived as one endless revel. Initiates to teh faith are taught that : ""life is to be lived to teh fullest. That which is good is pleasurable and that which is pleasurable is good. Spread the bounty of the goddess to that all may join in the Endless Revel of Life and bring joy to those in pain. Infinite experiences await those who would explore, so try the new as well as savoring the old.""

148905,,,"Siamorphe the Noble is a demipower worshiped primarily among the noble class of Waterdeep, and she is relatively unknown outside of that limited environment and Tethyr, where Zaranda Star has recently brought her worship into vogue. Siamorphe's ethos is that the noble class has the right to rule and the responsibility to rule in the best manner possible for the people who server under it. This is a very appealing ethos to some, particularly to nobles looking for some reason to explain why they are in charge. Nobles are the rightful rulers of the bulk of humankind provided that they keep themselves fit for the task and responsibilities of rule. Nobles have the moral obligation to rule in the best manner possible for the people who serve under them even if their obligations conflict with their personal desires.

148907,,,"Valkur the Might is a sailor's god, a demipower who intercedes to protect ships against the cruel whimsy of Umberlee and the destruction of Talos. He is often depicted as a giant sailor who wades through the ocean, which only comes up to his knees. He carries a great shield with which he turns back the worst of the forces of nature arrayed against him. There is nothing more invigorating than challenging the elements. The feel of wind and spray on one's face and the deck pitching before one's feet is the greatest feeling in the world. If humankind is to expand its reach, daring men and women must defy the odds and dare the impossible. The thrill of exploration is sweeter than wine or rum.

192599,,,"It's... not... over..."
192600,,,"Strange I... do not feel so well."
192601,,,"My spell disrupted? Arrgghh..."
192602,,,"Bah!  Useless weapon..."
192603,,,"It's about time you monkeys realized who should be leader."
192604,,,"'Tis like I see two or three of everything... I'm seeing four, definitely four..."
192606,,,"Back away, you obsequious fool."
192607,,,"Tedious monkey work..."
192608,,,"A waste of my talents."
192609,,,"I am concealed, though I see no need."
192610,,,"If I must..."
192611,,,"Go bother someone else."
192612,,,"Tedious monkey work..."
192613,,,"I will carry no more."
192614,,,"Yes.."
192615,,,"You simians may refer to me merely as sir."
192616,,,"Yes, yes... I see."
192617,,,"Of course not."
192618,,,"I thought I could think no less of this group but with THIS behavior..."
192619,,,"I require rest... I demand we stop."
192620,,,"Why do I suffer these fools?"
192621,,,"Goodbye then."
192623,,,"HA HA Ha ha ha...."
192624,,,"Elminster this, Elminster that... give ME two thousand years and a pointy hat, and I'll kick his arse!"
192625,,,"That will show them!"
192626,,,"They continue under the delusion that I care at all."
192628,,,"You are aware that silence is the virtue of fools?"
192629,,,"Question not my designs else you too will become an unwilling part of them."
192630,,,"Is this gonna to be scary? Because I warn you, I've been known to leap in to the arms of total strangers when startled."
192631,,,"I'll leave you devastated, mutilated and perforated."
192632,,,"Every enemy I’ve met I’ve annihilated."
192633,,,"Would you like to be buried or cremated."
192634,,,"My goodness, I think I'm dying...."
192635,,,"Y-You gotta help me."
192636,,,"Is there anybody in there who’s not evil or dead?"
192637,,,"I-I’ve changed my mind, I’ve decided to let you live."
192638,,,"I’m going to haunt you until you set me free."
192639,,,"La la la la…I can’t hear you…la la la la"
192640,,,"Mmm, the undead that walk among us must surely be destroyed, lest their evil like overrun and befoul the world of the living."
192641,,,"head foggy…….can’t think…."
192642,,,"Oh no!"
192643,,,"Unhh....I don't feel so..good..."
192644,,,"Not sure that was suppose to go like that."
192645,,,"Why did we just do that?"
192646,,,"Perfect ! I'll be your captain. Let's head on out and find our fortune."
192647,,,"Maybe I'll just take a look around."
192648,,,"Over here !"
192649,,,"No there's no time to worry about that now, we have to hurry !"
192650,,,"Watch me make this disappear."
192651,,,"Look!  A three headed monkey!"
192652,,,"Watch me disappear."
192653,,,"Alright, alright."
192654,,,"I really wish I didn't have to do that."
192655,,,"Hey, it worked."
192656,,,"Wherefore will I put it?"
192657,,,"What is it?"
192658,,,"Uhh Hi."
192659,,,"Well, of course."
192660,,,"I don't think so."
192661,,,"Quiet!  The voices in my head are telling me something."
192662,,,"Can I sit down?  Both my legs are going to sleep."
192663,,,"C'mon people, chop chop! I don't have all day."
192664,,,"Godspeed."
192665,,,"You know, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me."
192666,,,"Ha ha ha ha ha..."
192667,,,"This is so embarrassing."
192668,,,"Hey, I’m getting pretty good at this."
192669,,,"Music has charms to sooth the savage breasts.."
192670,,,"Good idea."
192671,,,"Who told you this was a good idea? You're insane."
192672,,,"*sings* Ohhh there’s  a monkey in my pocket and he’s stealing all my change…………"
192673,,,"Swords, not words!"
192674,,,"Go for the eyes, Boo ... GO FOR THE EYES! Yaaaarrgh !!!"
192675,,,"Feel the backhand of justice!"
192676,,,"Butt-kicking, for goodness!!"
192677,,,"I... I could use a bit of a lie down, lest I drop Boo on the battlefield.  Have we a healer near?"
192678,,,"I do not get through many battles without injury... why is Minsc always on the frontline taking damage?"
192679,,,"Evil 'round every corner... careful not to step in any..."
192680,,,"See battle, Boo? Run Boo, RUN! "
192681,,,"Jump on my sword while you can, evil... I won't be as gentle!"
192682,,,"Despair not, I will inspire you by charging blindly on!"
192683,,,"Stand back... for justice!"
192684,,,"I...must get aid soon...Boo is...too young to have to avenge me..."
192685,,,"take..care..of ....Boo........"
192686,,,"I need aid soon, lest my hamster become an orphan..."
192687,,,"I turned to shield Boo and have lost my spell... I am NOT sorry..."
192688,,,"I hit... to no effect?!?"
192689,,,"Magic is impressive, but now Minsc leads!  Swords for everyone!"
192690,,,"Boo likes the forest..."
192691,,,"Minsc will lead with blade and boot... Boo will take care of the details."
192692,,,"Make way villainy... hero coming through!"
192693,,,"The bigger they are, the harder I hit!"
192694,,,"Cities always teem with evil and decay... let's give it a good shake and see what falls out!"
192695,,,"None shall see me... though my battlecry may give me away..."
192696,,,"Where Minsc goes, evil stands aside!"
192697,,,"No effect?!? I need bigger sword..."
192698,,,"Boo says that he was just doing his job."
192699,,,"I have had to drop what you gave me... I have only two arms and no more space."
192700,,,"Minsc and Boo stand ready."
192701,,,"Hello..."
192702,,,"Armored, sharpened, and raring to go!"
192703,,,"Minsc and Boo... you forgot Boo!"
192704,,,"This behavior must not continue.  Feel the burning stare of my hamster and change your ways!"
192705,,,"We must rest soon... Boo is getting squirrelly!"
192706,,,"Boo must have his exercise, lest he bite us all in hard-to-reach places!"
192707,,,"Where goes the stench of evil, so goes the cleansing wind of Minsc and Boo!"
192708,,,"We do good things here.  All will remember the heroes that are Minsc and Boo and you."
192709,,,"Great fun!  Hehe... right, Boo?"
192710,,,"Don't teach my hamster to suck eggs!"
192711,,,"Ahhh, we are all heroes... you and Boo and I... hamsters and rangers everywhere... REJOICE!!!"
192712,,,"Live by the sword... live a good long time!"
192713,,,"Every hamster has his day!"
192714,,,"When making a glorious egg dish of goodness, I understand some eggs must be broken.  But actions such as this are ... simply deplorable!"
192715,,,"Boo can stand only sooo much..."
192716,,,"Onwards."
192717,,,"Defend yourself."
192718,,,"The hand of justice shall not be stayed."
192719,,,"Executing sentence"
192720,,,"I am wounded."
192721,,,"My armor has been breached."
192722,,,"Shadows are upon us."
192723,,,"You will not escape."
192724,,,"You are merciful and weak."
192725,,,"Know the eye of the mercy killer is watching."
192726,,,"Justice awaits."
192727,,,"Justice is... eternal."
192728,,,"I continue the battle beyond the Eternal Boundary..."
192729,,,"The disease spreads..."
192730,,,"Something interferes with my magic."
192731,,,"My axe cannot harm this creature."
192732,,,"The journey is a long one and our quest is urgent."
192733,,,"What's this?"
192734,,,"Your company continues to further the ends of justice."
192735,,,"We have little time."
192736,,,"How can this be?"
192737,,,"Justice is not blind... for I am her eyes."
192738,,,"I am hidden."
192739,,,"As you command."
192740,,,"I have failed."
192741,,,"Everything is in order."
192742,,,"I could not carry it."
192743,,,"What is thy bidding?"
192744,,,"Who goes there?"
192745,,,"Yes... I see."
192746,,,"This I cannot say."
192747,,,"Wait... I beg you."
192748,,,"Now, are you prepared to depart?"
192749,,,"While we wait, mercy and evil seeps into the hearts of more victims."
192750,,,"Travel swiftly and safely... we shall meet again."
192751,,,"Your company continues to further the ends of justice."
192752,,,"Hah ha ha."
192753,,,"Your actions cry out for justice."
192754,,,"Justice purges evil... once all have been cleansed, the multiverse achieves perfection."
192755,,,"Justice has fueled my efforts."
192756,,,"It is as the vision foretold."
192757,,,"Silence!"
192758,,,"You..."
192759,,,"My blade will cut you down to size."
192760,,,"Gotcha good.."
192761,,,"You asked for it."
192762,,,"Oh, I'll show you a fight."
192763,,,"I'm weak enough without my wounds... someone give me a hand over here, please....."
192764,,,"Oh please... I can't take this..."
192765,,,"All right!"
192766,,,"I got enough trouble without fighting these odds..."
192767,,,"I'll show you a fight!"
192768,,,"Right as rain."
192769,,,"We fall or we win."
192770,,,"no, No, NO!  I'm not dying here!"
192771,,,"I will... see death... come.  I'm so empty inside... I feel... I feel weak..."
192772,,,"I feel weak..."
192773,,,"My spell has failed..."
192774,,,"Nothing?  My attack did nothing?!?"
192775,,,"Oh, come on... I'm not cut out for the leadership stuff."
192776,,,"Something up?"
192777,,,"Time to move?"
192778,,,"If I have to fight to get out of here, so be it."
192779,,,"No problem at all."
192780,,,"This way then..."
192781,,,"Shhhhhhhhhh..."
192782,,,"Ready and willing."
192783,,,"I can't do that!"
192784,,,"You can count on me."
192785,,,"I simply can't carry all of this."
192786,,,"What'cha want?"
192787,,,"How are things going?"
192788,,,"Yep."
192789,,,"Uh-uh."
192790,,,"I'm withering away just standing here... let's get going."
192791,,,"*yawn*  I'm getting sleepy... I wish we could stop for a bit."
192792,,,"If we're going to do nothing, let's at least find a safer place to do it."
192793,,,"Good luck, I'll miss ya... although somehow I just know we'll see each other again.  Maybe I'll get you out of trouble again... you never know."
192794,,,"Thank you so very much."
192795,,,"Yeah... ok... whatever."
192796,,,"That is SO frustrating!"
192797,,,"Easy as pie."
192798,,,"He's... he's dead now?"
192799,,,"Right you are."
192800,,,"What?!? Nooo..."
192801,,,"You asked for it."
192802,,,"It's time to go hunting."
192803,,,"A good spray of blood! So very exhilarating."
192804,,,"Come over and play."
192805,,,"You've got this one coming!"
192806,,,"...I need help."
192807,,,"It... truly pains me to admit it but... I need help."
192808,,,"I always prefer to look them in the eyes...But this will do in a pinch."
192809,,,"I think I'll be retreating now....But do have fun."
192810,,,"*whistles* Here kitty!    Come over and play."
192811,,,"Do you have a problem that needs.....fixing."
192812,,,"Hmmm, I'm on it."
192813,,,"This is just not going to work out."
192814,,,"*croaks*"
192815,,,"Oh joy..."
192816,,,"Well, that's it. I've lost my spell; you'll have to do without."
192817,,,"My weapon appears to be useless."
192818,,,"Just remember....They're not down here with us.....You're all down here with me."
192819,,,"Well well, what do we have here?"
192820,,,"Just so we're clear. Anyone who screws up...is on their own.  "
192821,,,"Swiftly and sleekly."
192822,,,"This won't take but a moment."
192823,,,"Pushy, pushy, pushy."
192824,,,"Be very quiet."
192825,,,"Ask me..nicely."
192826,,,"This is just not going to work out."
192827,,,"Well, that’s it."
192828,,,"If you can't go without carrying so much, buy a mule!"
192829,,,"At your service..."
192830,,,"Well well."
192831,,,"Alright."
192832,,,"If I feel like it."
192833,,,"Oohh, Will you please stop squirming!"
192834,,,"Do you think we might stop for awhile? I get so testy when I'm tired."
192835,,,"I once heard it declared that boredom was the root of all evil. Considering my thoughts at the moment.....I'm beginning to agree."
192836,,,"Goodbye."
192837,,,"This will do in a pinch."
192838,,,"Ha ha ha ha ha"
192839,,,"Gah..The sun. I wish it would hurry up and set so I can get to work."
192840,,,"Ahhh, The happy hunting grounds of the city."
192841,,,"Nothing personal, simply better you than me."
192842,,,"Shhh shhh shhh shhh shhh....The night has come. This is my time."
192843,,,"You do like keeping me distracted. So do I."
192844,,,"My patience is gone. Your life goes with it."
192845,,,"Onward to Glory!"
192846,,,"Torm, Guide my sword!"
192847,,,"Repent ! Or face the wrath of a Just but Vengeful god."
192848,,,"By all that is holy, taste the sword of justice !"
192849,,,"Torm, recieve my soul..."
192850,,,"Friends, I am lost. Save yourselves."
192851,,,"Beware my friends."
192852,,,"Quickly!"
192853,,,"Ha! Feel the power of a righteous arm."
192854,,,"Torm guide me to my task."
192855,,,"Maybe there is another way."
192856,,,"Torm, Keep me alive a little longer that I might see this evil defeated."
192857,,,"Uarghhh....."
192858,,,"Oh no....."
192859,,,"Curse my inadequate concentration. I have wasted Torms gift."
192860,,,"Give me a sword with which I can vanquish this foe. I will not be helpless."
192861,,,"I will lead us through the darkness and into the light."
192862,,,"What was that?"
192863,,,"Here my friend."
192864,,,"Evil walks abroad in the land."
192865,,,"Setting traps is dishonorable, unethical and completely against the code of a warrior. Not to mention being impossible for a paladin."
192866,,,"There is no place to hide, I will find you."
192867,,,"I am.....uncomfortable with this subterfuge."
192868,,,"I will do what I can."
192869,,,"May Torm forgive my clumsiness."
192870,,,"By the sword of Torm, thy will be done."
192871,,,"I have never heard of a pack mule vanquishing evil. I am carrying enough!"
192872,,,"As you command, my liege."
192873,,,"Well met!"
192874,,,"I will do what must be done."
192875,,,"No."
192876,,,"There is always time for a rousing battle song."
192877,,,"Ohh,evil never sleeps but I'm afraid my friends there are times when we must."
192878,,,"Innocent and virtue fall victim to whims of tyrants and evil overlords. And yet, in Torm's name we stand here and do NOTHING!"
192879,,,"Farewell to you."
192880,,,"Thank you."
192881,,,"Hah hah ha..."
192882,,,"May Torm forgive my clumsiness."
192883,,,"Onward Righteous Soldier....."
192884,,,"We can only hope that the rule of law here also equates to the rule of justice."
192885,,,"Even the darkness of the blackest night is banished by the light of the moon and stars."
192886,,,"I've got a bad feeling about this."
192887,,,"The light of a righteous sun sends evil scurrying for the shadows."
192888,,,"Ahh..All the opportunity for mischief a girl could require."
192889,,,"Bleed you luckless bastard!"
192890,,,"C'mon, Lets see what color your blood is!"
192891,,,"Hold still fool, it'll be much less painful."
192892,,,"I need healing, quickly now!"
192893,,,"unhhh…"
192894,,,"Whats life without a little risk."
192895,,,"On my very best days I cheat death six times before breakfast."
192896,,,"Best watch your back, I'm on the prowl."
192897,,,"I'll toss the dice anytime you like."
192898,,,"Life is adventure or nothing."
192899,,,"Oww !"
192900,,,"uhh.... unhh.."
192901,,,"unhhh....Tis only a flesh wound."
192902,,,"Dammit!"
192903,,,"Dammit!"
192904,,,"Oh, so now you want me in charge? This is going to be fun."
192905,,,"Can't it wait? I just got distracted by something....shiny."
192906,,,"Where to next?"
192907,,,"All this peace and quiet is beginning to seriously fray my nerves."
192908,,,"A tripline carefully laid can yield delightful results."
192909,,,"There we go, new baubles for my collection."
192910,,,"you ever noticed that it's alot easier to raise hell in the cover of darkness, I'm particularly good at it."
192911,,,"Nothing ventured, Nothing gained."
192912,,,"This'll take extra mojo."
192913,,,"I’m done with this."
192914,,,"You want me to carry what?  Forget it! it's in the dirt."
192915,,,"What is your bidding?"
192916,,,"Greetings to you."
192917,,,"I’d say yes."
192918,,,"Has to be no."
192919,,,"Ahhh, a splendid day to go forth and sample all that the world has to offer."
192920,,,"Even the most prolific adventurer needs to take some time to rest."
192921,,,"My most profound hatred is reserverd for sitting and doing ...........nothing."
192922,,,"Goodbye to you."
192923,,,"I appreciate it."
192924,,,"Haha  Haha  Haha"
192925,,,"Dammit!"
192926,,,"Ooh, Good Shot!"
192927,,,"*sigh*   Another day, another dark, dangerous, gloomy hole in the ground."
192928,,,"Well, its better than twiddleling thumbs."
192929,,,"Oh Blast, Next time duck you idiot!"
192930,,,"I'll get you yet, my pretty."
192931,,,"I need to unwind, Lets go start a brawl !"
192932,,,"The storm rages with me !"
192933,,,"Ughh, You’ll feel my wrath for that."
192934,,," Surrender and I’ll make your death quick if not painless."
192935,,,"Heal me at once!"
192936,,,"If I die it’ll be with my teeth at your throat."
192937,,,"A gift of pain for the next fool who crosses my path."
192938,,,"You can’t evade me forever."
192939,,,"You dare stand against me, thy impudence shall come at high price."
192940,,,"I’ll obey…..for the moment."
192941,,,"Make it quick.."
192942,,,"*scowls in pain*"
192943,,,"unhhh……unghhh.."
192944,,,"*scowls in pain*"
192945,,,"*sigh*"
192946,,,"I see I’ll have to hit a little harder."
192947,,,"Tis long past time you recognized my strength."
192948,,,"There is something of interest here."
192949,,,"Have these people no sense of respect for the power of the Storm Lord."
192950,,,"Every last twig of this can be blown flat at any moment."
192951,,,"Hardly worth the time to rifle your purse."
192952,,,"Let us go slowly, and search all around."
192953,,,"I have become the storms shadow."
192954,,,"I’ll do thy toil."
192955,,,"a menial task, as usual."
192956,,,"So long as it suits my purpose."
192957,,,"You expect me to carry this in addition to all the other junk in my pack."
192958,,,"Speak thy piece."
192959,,,"Well Met."
192960,,,"Fine!"
192961,,,"Twist my arm like that again and you’ll lose teeth."
192962,,,"Hmph, the skies are far too clear for my liking."
192963,,,"Even the forces of nature must take time to gather themselves for another day."
192964,,,"Stone walls,I hate this….maybe an earthquake….."
192965,,,"Farewell, Until our next meeting."
192966,,,"Lightning Strikes!"
192967,,,"*grins*"
192968,,,"Try not my patience, worm."
192969,,,"Such is the way of things, the strong trample the corpses of the weak."
192970,,,"The simple truth of it is that the sound of thunder excites me like nothing else."
192971,,,"Explain thyself.."
192972,,,"It had best be important."
192973,,,"Watch thy back, Lest I lose patience with taking orders."
192974,,,"Me axe be bloody ready!"
192975,,,"Lets see what yer guts be lookin like."
192976,,,"For the Glory, Now you Die!"
192977,,,"A skull breaker!"
192978,,,"Get me some healin you blasted fool! Do it…Now!"
192979,,,"Arghh !!"
192980,,,"Bout time we got to business."
192981,,,"Arrr, There be time fer this battle another day."
192982,,,"I’ll split yer gut open.  *chuckles*"
192983,,,"aye, the dwarf will bloody do it."

192987,,,"Good god man! That hurts like…. when you take it in the *whooo*…no little French man could’ve live through that."
192988,,,"Damn!"
192989,,,"Damn!"
192990,,,"Aye, now this be more like it. The first to disobey me orders gets an axe in their skull."
192991,,,"What gives?"
192992,,,"Fine then logclobbers! I’ve put up with yer dribbling long enuf. I’ve work to do and it’ll not be with the likes of this girl wasted loon crew."
192993,,,"Out of my way Brat!"
192994,,,"I best be paid well for this."
192995,,,"This place needs a thorough search."
192996,,,"Hide! Be quick with it."
192997,,,"I’ll do as you tell, but only if there be a good amount of coin to be makin’"
192998,,,"Uhh pity it is……ahh well."
192999,,,"I be done."
193000,,,"whoaa.....this pack is too heavy."
193001,,,"Bark your orders already."
193002,,,"Good to see ya!"
193003,,,"Fine."
193004,,,"Eh?"
193005,,,"What is it then…speak up!"
193006,,,"When the day be done the day be done! I must rest, no argument."
193007,,,"So you be tired, we care not. Sleep when death takes a hold of you, which would be a welcome respite for the rest of us…god knows."
193008,,,"Farewell then."
193009,,,"Aye,  thanks for that."
193010,,,"Heh heh heh…"
193011,,,"Dang and Blast it! Over and over!"
193012,,,"Good Fight!"
193013,,,"I’ve something long, hard and low to the ground you’re free to touch and fondle.
hild, no need to glare. Twas me axe I was referring to. That’s a joke!
"
193014,,,"Aye, that be sound’n right."
193015,,,"Humph…"
193016,,,"hmm, I’ve killed for less."
193017,,,"Come! Come and kill me if you can."
193018,,,"Slippery as an eel, aren’t you."
193019,,,"Oooh… I just love a clean strike."
193020,,,"Killing is my business…. and business is good."
193021,,,"I need assistance!"
193022,,,"Aid me here."
193023,,,"Poor fools will never see me coming."
193024,,,"This just isn’t my element. All these trees and flowers and chirping birds, it’s enough to drive a girl mad."
193025,,,"Let me show you how heartless I am."
193026,,,"Heed my warning."
193027,,,"I’m on top of it."
193028,,,"Ugh!   I’ll make sure you regret that."
193029,,,"*groans*"
193030,,,"Uhh !"
193031,,,"Don’t disturb my concentration again, you might find it fatal."
193032,,,"That’s no damn use."
193033,,,"Oh….finally….some ambition will drive this group."
193034,,,"Hmmm…"
193035,,,"I love a crowd. Nothing but a herd of sheep lined up for the fleecing."
193036,,,"Ready when you are."
193037,,,"There’s always one last little detail."
193038,,,"Finders keepers…Losers weepers."
193039,,,"Dark, dank, and dusty though this may be, there’s a lot to be said for shadows this plentiful."
193040,,,"Don’t worry. I never disappoint."
193041,,,"I’ve never started something I didn’t finish."
193042,,,"Oh it’ll be done, but as always, there’s a price."
193043,,,"don’t have the room for such trinkets."
193044,,,"As you command."
193045,,,"Greetings."
193046,,,"Since you insist."
193047,,,"Just let me know."
193048,,,"Is there a problem?"
193049,,,"Ooh…would it be so much trouble to get some rest around here."
193050,,,"So much havoc to wreak. So little time….Lets get moving."
193051,,,"Farewell"
193052,,,"Thank you."
193053,,,"HA Ha ha ha ha"
193054,,,"That’s so simple it’s nearly an insult."
193055,,,"Such a pretty day for a killing."
193056,,,"How can you blame me for loving the night. It suits me so well."
193057,,,"Haven’t you ever seen a woman look this good and be this bad."
193058,,,"Poor thing, I guess your number’s up."
193059,,,"Watch your step."
193060,,,"I’m getting far too old for this."
193061,,,"This old dog still has a few tricks."
193062,,,"You can not pass!"
193063,,,"So be it."
193064,,,"Please heal me if you will be so kind."
193065,,,"Help me..."
193066,,,"Watch your step. I had a friend who didn’t once, …once."
193067,,,"The indignity."
193068,,,"Another case of pearls cast before swine."
193069,,,"Sane people are usually going to bed by now. Pity there don’t seem to be any in earshot."
193070,,,"What a nice day. I give it an hour before it’s irrevocably ruined."
193071,,,"Well, I’ll just expire quietly, shall I."
193072,,,"*croaks*"
193073,,,"I have been…poisoned."
193074,,,"Blast it!  My spell is ruined."
193075,,,"Blast it!"
193076,,,"Me?  Why I haven’t led a party since……oh, never mind. I’m sure this group will have a happier fate….I hope."
193077,,,"Well, fancy that."
193078,,,"You don’t have to shout."
193079,,,"Don’t rush me."
193080,,,"Please unlock this."
193081,,,"Much is not as it seems here."
193082,,,"I walk… unseen. "
193083,,,"Very well."
193084,,,"Well now, Isn’t this wonderfully futile."
193085,,,"ah, Typical."
193086,,,"Get one of these young bucks to fetch and carry, I’m full up."
193087,,,"I hear you."
193088,,,"I greet you."
193089,,,"Yes, yes."
193090,,,"Will it never end."
193091,,,"Why I continue to subject myself to these dank holes, I’ll never know."
193092,,," Planning to march around all day are we? Have pity on an old man."
193093,,,"I wouldn’t mind this inactivity so much except I’m afraid I might die in my sleep."
193094,,,"I’m going."
193095,,,"Thanks."
193096,,,"Ha ha ha ha"
193097,,,"All this noise and commotion…Cities!.. Fa!, no respect for the elderly."
193098,,,"*sings*"
193099,,,"You think you have it bad. In my day, we faced down 7 demon princes before breakfast, uphill, both ways in a blizzard. .....  *mumbles to himself*"
193100,,,"This isn’t so bad you know, provided there’s a good stump or two to rest upon."
193101,,,"*sigh* Another companion gone. So many many lost."
193102,,,"Respect your betters!"
193103,,,"Onward then, and into the annals of legend."
193104,,,"Honor and Glory shall be ours!"
193105,,,"I’ll have your throat cut sooner than you can blink."
193106,,,"In the name of the Vhistani, I curse you!"
193107,,,"I require aid."
193108,,,"Is this my lot in life….
"
193109,,,"Have a care. The shadows around here they have…uh teeth."
193110,,,"This is hardly the stuff of legends."
193111,,,"You’ll regret crossing my path."
193112,,,"Is this my lot in life, to go and fetch and do?"
193113,,,"As I am bid."
193114,,,"Unnnhh!"
193115,,," Uhh…….unhhh……"
193116,,,"This requires special treatment."
193117,,,"My focus is shattered."
193118,,,"Fah! I can do better than that."
193119,,,"What is needed?"
193120,,,"What is this?"
193121,,,"What precisely is your desire?"
193122,,,"The daylight hours are so precious."
193123,,,"This requires special treatment."
193124,,,"Danger is always closest to the night."
193125,,,"Don’t look too closely... the shadows are friends of mine."
193126,,,"With grace and speed as always."
193127,,,"Do you think this is as easy as it looks."
193128,,,"Simpler done than said."
193129,,,"My hands are occupied enough as it is."
193130,,,"But ask and I shall answer."
193131,,,"'Ello."
193132,,,"Since you insist."
193133,,,"No doubt."
193134,,,"As usual, something dangerous behind every tree."
193135,,,"*yawn*     Best we consider turning in for the night. My reflexes are not so sharp."
193136,,,"If all I wanted from life was to stand around and whistle, I would be doing it in a far safer place than this."
193137,,,"Goodbye."
193138,,,"You want something?"
193139,,,"ah ha ha ha ...."
193140,,,"Fah!"
193141,,,"*sings*"
193142,,,"This city's many voices they make a music of their own."
193143,,,"The sagas will remember your deeds forever."
193144,,,"You’ll remember that one for awhile."
193145,,,"This best be quick, I’m looking forward to a bottle of decent wine."
193146,,,"For Justice! For Freedom!"
193147,,,"Whatever it takes, you will fall."
193148,,,"Bright Lady, let my strike be swift!"
193149,,,"Struck to the heart."
193150,,,"The world will be the brighter for my having lived. I swear it."
193151,,,"Ugh! I can't take much more of this."
193152,,,"I pity the next fool who walks careless though here."
193153,,,"Just once I'd like a day without mayhem."
193154,,,"Pathetic."
193155,,,"As always, ready to serve"
193156,,,"Lady of Light, lend me the strength to do one more impossible thing today."
193157,,,"Ugh!"
193158,,,"Uh  unhhh......."
193159,,,"Ugh!"
193160,,,"Dammit! That was a waste of syllables."
193161,,,"No good. I can't hit hard enough."
193162,,,"The light ever guides me....And now, us.  "
193163,,,"My path is clear."
193164,,,"I've never understood how people can be comfortable in a crowd."
193165,,," I've got much to accomplish and it's not getting done standing here."
193166,,,"That's no problem."
193167,,,"Come on..search!    It's gotta be here somewhere."
193168,,,"The shadows embrace me."
193169,,,"Easily enough."
193170,,,"No good."
193171,,,"Simple and straightforward."
193172,,,"You'll be sorry to hear this.. but...I'm no pack mule."
193173,,,"As you will, it shall be done."
193174,,,"Pleased to meet you."
193175,,,"Naturally."
193176,,,"No."
193177,,,"Nothing grants me a moments peace more quickly than the quiet of the wood."
193178,,,"There are only so many hours in a day and I've lost count. Could we stop and rest?"
193179,,,"I vastly prefer fresh air to this kind of confinement. Could we please finish up?"
193180,,,"Well then, I'll see you later."
193181,,,"Just doing my part to lighten your step."
193182,,,"Ha ha ha....."
193183,,,"Damn it!"
193184,,,"Nights' cloak is drawn across the land. Once there was only dark but see, there are the stars. The light is winning."
193185,,,"You must understand I've never wanted anything more than peace, but I found I have no choice but to fight."
193186,,,"It's a relief to see daylight. I've become too accustomed to the shadow."
193187,,,"One of these days you'll provide a challenge."
193188,,,"Mark my words. You'll pay for that."
193189,,,"I’ll send you back to the hell you came from."
193190,,,"I assure you my blade’s as sharp as my wit."
193191,,,"I ain’t as soft as I look."
193192,,,"Dead center!"
193193,,,"Help me darlin’."
193194,,," If somebody doesn’t help me quick. That’s gonna be it for my charming repartee."
193195,,,"All told I really do prefer my wildlife at a little bit more of a distance."
193196,,,"I guess that ain’t gonna work."
193197,,,"You’re lookin right at me, ain’t cha?"
193198,,,"I suppose I have a duty."
193199,,,"There are so many places I’d rather be."
193200,,,"Unhh!!"
193201,,,"Uhh….Unhhh…."
193202,,,"Poison!"
193203,,,"Damn. So much for my concentration."
193204,,,"I guess that ain’t gonna work."
193205,,," Well it’s about time you showed some sense."
193206,,,"Look at this."
193207,,,"Ain’t there nobody else to do your fetching?"
193208,,,"What a relief to be back someplace that at least resembles civilization."
193209,,,"Something subtle…to snare the foolish."
193210,,," It’s not like I need this trinket but it’s always satisfying to do something well."
193211,,,"Stealin softly as the morning mist."
193212,,,"Won’t take but a minute."
193213,,,"Somethin needs fixin, I’m sure."
193214,,,"It’ll be done before you know it."
193215,,,"I suppose you think I’m well suited to being treated like a common laborer. I ain’t carryin’ no more."
193216,,,"I hear you just fine darlin."
193217,,,"Why hello there."
193218,,,"Since you ask so sweetly."
193219,,,"oh no."
193220,,,"Well if you want it done right."
193221,,,"Mmm..We been goin a long time now. I don’t suppose we considered takin a break?"
193222,,,"You know if we’re gonna stand around. We could at least do it someplace more comfortable."
193223,,,"I’ll see you later."
193224,,,"You do realize that I oblige...merely because I am too….refined to do otherwise."
193225,,,"Ha ha ha...."
193226,,,"Damn."
193227,,,"A ladys work is never done."
193228,,,"I’ve always been told that moonlight shows off my complexion…to the best advantage."
193229,,," That’s good enough for me."
193230,,,"I see that chivalry is every bit as dead as I had been led to believe."
193231,,,"Oh no you ain’t gonna take anything that’s mine."
193232,,,"The innocent will be avenged!"
193233,,,"Justice will prevail!"
193234,,,"You’ve made your last mistake."
193235,,,"I will not falter. Gods give me strength."
193236,,,"I should not fall to these wounds."
193237,,,"My soul strives on."
193238,,,"Be on guard."
193239,,,"This evil is too strong."
193240,,,"You die this day."
193241,,,"With my last breath, I will protect those in my care."
193242,,,"If it preserves even one innocent life, let it be done."
193243,,,"Unhh!!!"
193244,,,"unnh…Unhh….."
193245,,,"A poison runs through me..."
193246,,,"My concentration is gone."
193247,,,"Hmph!  No good."
193248,,,"This is a place the decent should not tread. Nonetheless we must delve it to insure what is here does not emerge."
193249,,,"Hmmm…"
193250,,,"On my way."
193251,,,"Ever onwards."
193252,,,"It's locked."
193253,,,"You have my attention."
193254,,,"At times even the righteous must walk unseen."
193255,,,"Absolutely."
193256,,,"Hmph! Try, try again."
193257,,,"Done."
193258,,,"I bear a heavy enough burden already. Away with your worldly goods."
193259,,,"Tell me your counsel."
193260,,,"Welcome."
193261,,,"Yes."
193262,,,"Perhaps....perhaps you are right."
193263,,,"What is the meaning of this?"
193264,,,"My soul strives on but my flesh tires. I need rest."
193265,,,"Patience is virtue but we accomplish nothing remaining here."
193266,,,"Goodbye and good luck."
193267,,,"Thank you for your aid."
193268,,,"Ha ha ha"
193269,,,"By the hells!"
193270,,,"The world cannot be counted upon to protect those who have done no wrong. Where evil threatens, there I will stand."
193271,,,"Every soul has it’s night, but even darkness has a chance to be pure."
193272,,,"I believe in law but I believe in justice most of all."
193273,,,"Sometimes the rules must be bent for the greater good."
193274,,,"No! Murderers! I’ll have your heads for this."
193275,,,"Time for a little recon."
193276,,,"You don’t get in my way and live."
193277,,,"Mercy has no place here."
193278,,,"Target acquired."
193279,,,"Uhh unh….cleric…"
193280,,,"Man down."
193281,,,"Forests.  Any number of enemies could be hiding right under our noses. Keep a sharp lookout."
193282,,,"Suggest a fallback."
193283,,,"Impress me."
193284,,,"Night time is the perfect time for an ambush. Let’s make sure it’s our ambush."
193285,,,"What’s the report?"
193286,,,"Uhh!!"
193287,,,"ugnhhh nhhhh……"
193288,,,"*cough*  Ohhh shit."
193289,,,"I lost my spell. Hope you have a plan B."
193290,,,"I can’t hurt this thing."
193291,,,"You put me in command. You do what I tell you. We’ll make it through this."
193292,,,"Hmmm…"
193293,,,"Snowed under by a bunch of damn parasite civilians. If I were in charge, there’d be discipline here."
193294,,,"Sorry friend, didn’t mean to bump into you."
193295,,,"One step closer to the objective."
193296,,,"Hmmm, I’ve seen worst than this in my time. Still, stay sharp for trouble."
193297,,,"Might not be honorable but it’s damned effective."
193298,,,"I’ll take care of it."
193299,,,"By any means necessary."
193300,,," I’ll get things done."
193301,,,"Can’t carry anymore. My humble apologies."
193302,,,"Some people say I’m heartless. That’s not true. I just do whatever it takes to get the job done."
193303,,,"Hello friend."
193304,,,"Acknowledged."
193305,,,"No chance."
193306,,,"Hurry up and wait…That’s fine, I’m a patient man."
193307,,,"I can’t function as well when I’m tired. Requesting permission for some R and R."
193308,,,"I look up at the sun, I don’t see beauty. I wonder how many corpses greeted its rising today."
193309,,,"Goodbye friend."
193310,,," My humble apologies."
193311,,,"Heh heh heh ...."
193312,,,"Damn."
193313,,,"I love it when a plan comes together."
193314,,,"*inhale* I love the smell of fireballs in the morning. It smells like victory."
193315,,,"That’s fine."
193316,,,"That’s not true."
193317,,,"Poor bastard doesn’t have a chance."
193318,,,"Once more, Onto the breach!"
193319,,,"It may not be entirely poetic but I'm going to eat your head now!"
193320,,,"Oww! it's cutting this one is."
193321,,,"Oh come on!"
193322,,,"I think a new plan might be in order."
193323,,,"Ooh!"
193324,,,"I think I see our quarry."
193325,,,"Fight'en is constrainin’ me and I would feign lie down."
193326,,,"Not a wise choice."
193327,,,"Right!"
193328,,,"What's my motivation?"
193329,,,"I-Is my death really in the script....."
193330,,,"Ohh..bloody..hell...."
193331,,,"Ohh..bloody..hell...."
193332,,,"Gaw! I lost track of my spell."
193333,,,"Bloody equipment!"
193334,,,"I can hardly see a thing in this dark. But probably more than you lot *snort*"
193335,,,"What?"
193336,,,"I have the most cunning plan."
193337,,,"In a jiff."
193338,,,"*snort* Oy…Watch the fingers now."
193339,,,"Ahh!"
193340,,,"That's my cue."
193341,,,"On the case."
193342,,,"I can’t."
193343,,,"I got it."
193344,,,"Oh come on! There are limits to what one man can carry."
193345,,,"What wantest thou?"
193346,,,"Nice day, isn’t it?"
193347,,,"Right-O."
193348,,,"Ahh, typical."
193349,,,"This is the forest primeval, the....the uh...uh. I can't remember the rest."
193350,,,"Through Dungeon Deep we crawl and creep. And then we halt, when we're not at our best we..take a rest. Eh...Al-Alright, I-I'll stop. "
193351,,,"All this standing about gives me the urge to soliloquize."
193352,,,"Allright then."
193353,,,"Thanks."
193354,,,"Heh He He…that was a good one."
193355,,,"Heh, Everybody's a critic."
193356,,,"*snort* Another masterful performance."
193357,,,"Ah, Civilization! Where a man of my talents can truly shine."
193358,,,"What a wise choice you have made."
193359,,,"Alas poor….oh, I really didn’t know you."
193360,,,"Oy…Please refrain from disturbing the artist."
193361,,,"Well if they won’t listen to reason I guess that leaves only one alternative."
193362,,,"Never mess with the best."
193363,,,"It’s nothing personal but I’m gonna have to take you down."
193364,,,"Time to dish out another free lesson."
193365,,,"Don’t you worry about me. *cough*"
193366,,,"*cough*  Just a scratch, really… "
193367,,,"You’d think there’d be somethin."
193368,,,"You know I’m beginning to have second thoughts about this particular mission."
193369,,,"You want it…..You got it….."
193370,,,"Somethin you need takin care of?"
193371,,,"Now, you are lookin at my good side, right?"
193372,,,"Unhhh…"
193373,,,"Uhh …damn your ass…..unhhh….."
193374,,,"*cough, cough*"
193375,,,"You’d think there’d be the common courtesy to let a man cast his spell in peace."
193376,,,"I’m hittin the thing but it seems to just be enjoyin it."
193377,,,"Waitin on you chief."
193378,,,"Now would you look at that."
193379,,,"A night like this will make a man reflect upon the good things in his life. And make him want a heck of a lot more."
193380,,,"mmm..Well mercy, what a wonderful smell we’ve discovered down here. Now that we’ve experienced it fully, anyone else vote we go."
193381,,,"This outta snare something."
193382,,,"Watch closely now and you just might learn something."
193383,,,"You know, a gentlemen would never sneak about like this. Good thing I’m no gentlemen."
193384,,,"Anything for you."
193385,,,"Now would you look at that."
193386,,,"I’m done."
193387,,,"You know, I’d love to carry this for you but I like to travel light."
193388,,,"Lookin for a good frontman, are you? You came to the right person."
193389,,,"Hell-lo Gorgeous."
193390,,,"Just what I was thinkin."
193391,,,"Do you mind?"
193392,,,"Well I was just standin around doing nuthin."
193393,,,"Now you know personally I’m not one to complain but the others look like they can use some rest."
193394,,,"Trees, big leafy trees. And lots of bugs too. Isn’t that nice…We’re not gonna be here too long are we?"
193395,,,"You just go right ahead."
193396,,,"Glad to oblige."
193397,,,"Now would you look at that, that there sun is shining almost as brightly as my smile."
193398,,,"Damn bastard."
193399,,,"A mans work is never done."
193400,,,"I love the city! Wine, Women and Song but most of all, opportunity."
193401,,,"Great idea. I’m glad I thought of it."
193402,,,"You really like to give orders, don't cha?"
193403,,,"I didn’t miss, that was a warnin shot."

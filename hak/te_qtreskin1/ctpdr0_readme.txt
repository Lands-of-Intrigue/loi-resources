Summary/Critique/Tips/Notes:

NOTE: This reskin REQUIRES the Bioware Dungeon Tileset to work. This should not be a problem unless you are using the default Bioware Dungeon in your mod. If you are then do NOT attempt to install this hak. Otherwise, this is a complete replacement for the Bioware Dungeon and really makes that dungeon look good.
This should probably be called the 'Dusty Dungeon' as the look and feel is more brown and dusty in nature. If this had been a complete tileset with it's own tiles, we could have also made the tiles dusty when walking. As it stands, since this is a texture replacement only, there was no work done on the actual physical tiles themselves.
